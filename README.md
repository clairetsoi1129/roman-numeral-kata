### Assumption for roman numeral to digit:
1. The input is valid roman numeral

### Assumption for digit to roman numeral:
1. The input is a valid integer range from 1 - 3000

## What if my assumption is wrong? I need to handle the invalid case.

### Validation for roman numeral to digit:
1. Check the input only contains M/C/D/L/X/V/I
2. M, C, X, I at most appear 3 times together
3. CM,CD,D,XC,XL,L,IX,IV,V can appear 0-1 times
4. The characters should follow the sequence, except CM/CD/XC/XL/IX/IV

### Validation for digit to roman numeral:
1. The input is within range of 1-3000
2. The input is not a decimal number
3. The input is not a negative number
4. The input is not a alphabet

### Some thought about TDD:
1. Put on tester's hat to derived the test cases, especially the exception case. Think how other people will test my code without having the same assumptions as mine.
